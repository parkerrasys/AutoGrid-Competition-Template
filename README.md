### Version History

>**Version 0.1.0-alpha (3/21/25)**
>- Changes/Additions
>  ~ Added grid based system for moving the robot
>- Current State
>  ~ Auton starts slow, time in between moving to position is also slow (requires an inertial sensor)
>- Notes
>  ~ Slow start is most likely due to calculations taking time to run. Currently working on a fix for this.
